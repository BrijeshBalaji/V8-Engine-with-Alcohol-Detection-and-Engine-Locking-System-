# 🚗 V8 Engine with Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System

An intelligent vehicle safety prototype that integrates a **V8 engine model** with an **alcohol detection and automatic engine-locking system**. The system detects alcohol concentration near the driver and automatically prevents engine operation when the detected alcohol level exceeds a predefined safety threshold.

The main objective of this project is to reduce drunk-driving incidents by combining **real-time alcohol monitoring**, **automatic engine control**, and **embedded system technology**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Drunk driving is one of the major causes of road accidents worldwide. Traditional vehicles depend entirely on the driver's responsibility and do not have an automatic mechanism to detect alcohol consumption before starting the engine.

This project provides a smart safety solution using an **alcohol sensor** and a **microcontroller-based control system**. The alcohol sensor continuously monitors the driver's breath. The detected alcohol value is processed by the microcontroller and compared with a predefined threshold.

If the detected alcohol level is within the safe range, the engine is allowed to operate normally. If the alcohol level exceeds the safety threshold, the system activates the engine-locking mechanism and prevents the engine from operating.

## 🔄 Working Principle

1. The alcohol sensor detects the alcohol concentration near the driver's breath.

2. The detected sensor value is continuously transmitted to the ESP32 or microcontroller.

3. The microcontroller processes the sensor data and compares it with a predefined alcohol safety threshold.

4. If the detected alcohol concentration is below the threshold:

   * The engine control system remains enabled.
   * The V8 engine model is allowed to operate normally.

5. If the detected alcohol concentration exceeds the threshold:

   * The microcontroller activates the engine-locking mechanism.
   * The engine operation is automatically disabled.
   * A warning alert can be generated using a buzzer or LED indicator.

6. The engine remains locked until the alcohol concentration returns to the permitted safety range.
